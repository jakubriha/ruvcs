# Ruvcs aka RUst Version Control System

A personal toy project written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) implementing a distributed version control system similar to [Git](https://git-scm.com). My reasons for working on this project are to learn Rust and to better understand the architecture of Git.
